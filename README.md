# Skim-RSS-Reader
This is a simmple RSS reader built as a training exercise and  based on the final project requirements for the Udacity Android Development course.

Key requirements were that the ap uses an SQLite database, Provider, Loader and an Intent Service.

The app loads and displays new articles from the Racer-X breaking news feed ("http://racerxonline.com/feeds/rss/category/breaking-news").
Articles are opened in a new WebView fragment.

Features such as notifications, request batching and the Tablet layout were de-scoped due to time constraints.
